# Highly Available VPC Architecture on AWS

This project demonstrates the deployment of a secure, scalable, and highly available Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment on AWS. The architecture is designed for production-grade workloads and follows AWS best practices for network segmentation and resiliency.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview 

- Multi-AZ VPC setup
- Public and Private Subnets
- Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- Auto Scaling Group for elastic compute scaling
- NAT Gateways for secure outbound internet access
- Security Groups & NACLs for layered protection

## ✨ Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| VPC | Isolated network environment |
| Subnets (Public & Private) | Organize resources & control exposure |
| Internet Gateway | Enables public access for ALB |
| NAT Gateway (Multi-AZ) | Secure outbound connectivity from private instances |
| Auto Scaling Group | Automatically scales EC2 capacity |
| Application Load Balancer | Balances traffic across instances |

## 🎯 The 4 TOs

- **TO Scale:** Auto Scaling adapts to traffic
- 

- **TO Secure:** Workloads run in private subnets
- **TO Balance:** ALB improves performance and uptime
- **TO Connect:** NAT Gateways enable controlled outbound access

## 📦 Technologies Used
